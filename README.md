## Notes
1. Try to register only essential components globally, like a BaseButton or an input, and register locally all the rest.
2. Component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components.
3. There is also another way to distribute content to components using slots.
4. When you need to pass HTML or other markup to a component, slots are the way to go.
5. When you need to pass data to a component, props are perfect.
6. The best way to learn code is by writing code.
